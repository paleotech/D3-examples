D3 examples by Jim Hurst

The files here are examples of applying the Data Drive Documents libraries by Michael Bostock to medical information. The meat of the 
examples are in the files cptBubble.js, cptFinancial.js, and hourHeatmap.js. Everything needed to run these locally should be in this
repo, but you can cut to the chase by peeking at the images files cptBubble.js, cptFinancial.js, and hourHeatmap.js. Enjoy!
